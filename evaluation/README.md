# Evaluation: Baguette on SoMeSci

[`scripts/eval_somesci.py`](../scripts/eval_somesci.py) measures how well [Baguette](../models/README.md#baguette-dataesr) finds software mentions, with precision, recall and F1 against the human annotations of [SoMeSci](../datasets/README.md#somesci). It uses the version converted by SoFAIR on 🤗 [`SoFairOA/somesci_dataset`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoFairOA/somesci_dataset).

Three steps, one config at a time:

1. `prepare`: write the gold annotations and the Baguette inputs.
2. Run Baguette with the batch client of [lm-inference](../models/README.md#lm-inference).
3. `evaluate`: score the outputs.

## The data

The dataset only has a `test` split, in three configs:

| Config | Documents | What a document is |
|---|---|---|
| `plos_sentences` | 677 | a sentence |
| `plos_methods` | 480 | the methods section of a PLoS paper |
| `pubmed_fulltext` | 97 | a full PMC paper |

The `default` config is a copy of `pubmed_fulltext`.

- **Annotations:** BIO tags on tokens, with the character offset of each token, plus a `software` list per document: name, type, alternative name, abbreviation, version, developer, URL…
- **Software types:** `APPLICATION`, `PLUGIN`, `PROGRAMMINGENVIRONMENT`, `OPERATINGSYSTEM`, `SOFTWARECOREFERENCE`.
- **No mention types:** this version has no usage / creation / deposition / mention, so Baguette's `role` is not scored. The original SoMeSci (brat files on Zenodo) has them.
- **Gated:** accept the conditions on the dataset page. To download with the script, log in with `hf auth login`, using a token allowed to read gated repositories (fine-grained tokens: tick *public gated repositories*). Or download the parquet files yourself and use `--source`.

## 1. Prepare

```bash
uv run python scripts/eval_somesci.py prepare                           # downloads the three configs
uv run python scripts/eval_somesci.py prepare --source data/somesci/    # a local copy of the dataset
uv run python scripts/eval_somesci.py prepare --config plos_sentences   # only some configs
```

- **`--source`:** a folder with the layout of the 🤗 repo (`<config>/test-00000-of-00001.parquet`). A parquet file with the config in its name also works.
- **`--out`:** where to write; default `data/somesci/`, which is not in git.

It writes:

- **`gold/<config>.jsonl`:** one document per line, with `id`, `file` (the file name used for the document), `text`, `entities` (`start`, `end`, `label`, `text`) and `software`.
- **`input/<config>/<file>.json`:** the Baguette input, `{"paragraphs": [...]}`. Sentences and methods sections are one paragraph each. Full papers are split at blank lines, or at line breaks when there is none. The server splits the long paragraphs into pieces of about 200 tokens.

It prints, per config, the number of documents and entities, and the number of span/token mismatches, which should be 0.

## 2. Run Baguette

Use the batch client of lm-inference, with the `--no-analyze` option (the article-level step is not needed):

```bash
URL=https://sciencialab--baguette-software-dataset-app-extract-endpoint.modal.run/
for c in plos_sentences plos_methods pubmed_fulltext; do
  python lm-inference/deployments/baguette/baguette_client.py --endpoint $URL \
    --input-folder data/somesci/input/$c \
    --output-dir data/somesci/baguette/$c \
    --csv-output data/somesci/baguette/$c.csv --threads 4 --no-analyze
done
```

- **How many calls:** 1,254 documents in all, each a call to the GPU service. Try a few first, especially the full papers.
- **Resuming:** `--csv-output` makes the run resumable. A second run skips the documents that succeeded and retries the failed ones.
- **Output:** one `<file>.json.json` per document.

## 3. Evaluate

```bash
uv run python scripts/eval_somesci.py evaluate --config plos_sentences
uv run python scripts/eval_somesci.py evaluate --config plos_sentences --explicit-only
```

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--config` | (required) | `plos_sentences`, `plos_methods` or `pubmed_fulltext` |
| `--data` | `data/somesci` | the `--out` folder of `prepare` |
| `--baguette-dir` | `<data>/baguette/<config>` | the Baguette outputs |
| `--explicit-only` | off | leave out the mentions Baguette marks `implicit` |
| `--out` | `<data>/results/<config>.json` | the JSON results |

A document without a Baguette output counts as one with no prediction. The number of these is printed, and their ids are in the results.

### What is compared

- **Gold software:** the `APPLICATION`, `PLUGIN`, `PROGRAMMINGENVIRONMENT` and `OPERATINGSYSTEM` entities. `SOFTWARECOREFERENCE` ("the software", "this tool") is left out.
- **Predictions:** the `name` of every software mention in `paragraphs[].software`, made unique per document. When a name is repeated, the first mention is kept, or the first one with a `version`.
- **Normalisation:** lower case, whitespace collapsed, punctuation removed at both ends.

Matching is one-to-one and the scores are micro-averaged over all the documents.

### Document level

The software of a document (its `software` list) against the unique predicted names. A predicted name matches a software if it matches its name, its alternative name or one of its abbreviations.

| Metric | A name matches when |
|---|---|
| `doc_exact` | it is the same after normalisation |
| `doc_relaxed` | all the words of one are in the other: `SPSS` ~ `IBM SPSS Statistics`, `ResearchIR MAX 4.0` ~ `ResearchIR MAX` |

Predicting a software under two of its names, such as `Statistical Parametric Mapping` and `SPM`, gives one true positive. The second name is not counted as a false positive.

### Mention level

Baguette gives names without positions. The script searches the text for each predicted name, case-insensitively and as whole words; every occurrence is a predicted span. If the name is not in the text, it searches again without the version (`SPSS v25` → `SPSS`). When two spans overlap, the longer one is kept.

| Metric | A predicted span matches a gold span when |
|---|---|
| `mention_strict` | they have the same offsets |
| `mention_overlap` | they overlap |

- **Names not in the text:** a name that is not found in the text, even without its version, counts as one false positive. Such names are paraphrased or invented.
- **Abbreviations:** a span that only falls on an annotated abbreviation or alternative name, such as `SPM` in `Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)`, is not counted.

### Versions

`version` is scored only on the software found at document level (relaxed match).

- **Recall:** the share of the gold versions of these software that appear in the predicted `version` field or in the predicted name.
- **Precision:** a predicted `version` field that is not one of the gold versions is a false positive.

### Output

The script prints a summary and a table:

```
plos_sentences: 677 documents, <n> without Baguette output, <n> predicted names (<n> not found in the text)
level                  P       R      F1     TP     FP     FN
doc_exact          ...
doc_relaxed        ...
mention_strict     ...
mention_overlap    ...
version            ...
recall by type (document relaxed / mention overlap):
  APPLICATION              ... / ...
```

The JSON results have:

- **`metrics`:** precision, recall, F1, TP, FP and FN for each level.
- **`recall_by_type`:** recall by software type at both levels, and the number of gold software of each type.
- **`errors`:** per document, the `false_positives` and `false_negatives` at document level (relaxed), and the names `not_in_text`. Start the error analysis here.
- **`missing_output_ids`:** the documents without a Baguette output.

## Limits

- **Roles are not scored:** see [The data](#the-data).
- **Lexical identity:** SoMeSci tells software apart by name, so `SPSS` and `IBM SPSS Statistics` in one paper are two gold software. Finding only one of them gives a false negative.
- **Short names:** at mention level, a short name such as `R` matches every standalone `R` of the text. That can lower the mention-level precision.
- **Mentions lost between pieces:** the server cuts long paragraphs into pieces of about 200 tokens, and a mention split between two pieces can be lost.
- **No offsets:** the mention level is an approximation. It assumes Baguette finds every occurrence of a name it gives once.
